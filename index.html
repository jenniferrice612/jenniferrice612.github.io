          <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
          <p>
            Jennifer directed and produced her first short film in the sixth grade, based on a book report. The class was instructed to present an oral presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in the spirit of  <strong>ingenuity</strong>, Jennifer recruited her peers to develop a cast. She then created a "set" at her grandparent's house, where they reenacted scenes that best summarized the book. During the premiere of the short film, the class responded with excitement and curiosity. It was then she recognized her <strong>purpose and passion</strong> for storytelling and public speaking and started on her path to becoming an <strong>entertainment journalist</strong>.
